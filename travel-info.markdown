# Travel

Welcome! We're exicted for you to join us in the Pacific Northwest! The event center is about an hour and a half drive north of Seattle, on beautiful Whidbey Island.

## Getting to Seattle

Seattle's main airport is Seattle-Tacoma international (SEA), south of the city. You may also consider flying into Everett (PAE) or Bellingham (BLI) which have limited service. Also consider Amtrak, BoltBus, and other transportation options. 

## Getting to Whidbey Island

With the Camp Casey event center situated slightly north of the middle of the island, if you're coming from Seattle, you have a choice to either take the ferry from the south or drive to the bridge at the north. Check ferry schedules and wait times. At busy times (such as friday evenings and sunday afternoons) the ferry does fill up, and if you have to wait even one sailing it is often *faster to drive around*.

## Getting to the Athlete's Village and Event Center

The Athlete's Village and Event Center is located at Camp Casey, just off Hwy 20 just north of Fort Casey

## Getting to the Events

### Putney Woods (Model Map)

### South Whidbey Community Park (Sprint)

### Fort Ebey State Park (Saturday Long)

Parking is limited at Fort Ebey State park, and *all participants and volunteers* must take a free shuttle to the park. Team vans will be allowed to drop off participants but the driver must park at the shuttle location. A discover pass is required for all vehicles entering the state park, even those just dropping off participants.

### Fort Casey State Park (Sunday Middle)

## Travel Notes

The Whidbey Island Marathon is being held on Sunday morning. If you're arriving on Sunday morning from North of the event center, **the Deception Pass Bridge (Hwy 20) will close at 6:45am** for about an hour for the start of the race. Even after the road re-opens, expect delays from the Deception Pass Bridge to Oak Harbor.
