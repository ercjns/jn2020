# Athletes' Village

We're providing a unique athletes' village experience - there will be activities on site in the evenings, easy access to all of the orienteering venues, and opportunities to meet and learn from your fellow competitors, all for a simple room and board fee.

Reserve your spot in Athletes' Village when you register for orienteering on EventReg. (Coaches, Parents, Chaperones, and other non-racers staying at Athlete's Village must also reserve a spot via Event Reg, simply click through race registration - Athlete's Village is on the very last page.)

### Lodging

Lodging at the Camp Casey Event Center is restored military housing from the early 1990s. We have a mix of beds in bunkrooms and dorms. More details about the lodging can be found <a href="https://casey.spu.edu/staying-at-camp-casey/lodging/">here</a>. You'll be assigned to a floor based on gender. A limited number of beds are available for Thursday arrivals as well as Monday departures. 

### Meals

Meals will be in the Camp Casey Dining Hall - a great opportunity to spend some time meeting new friends over a meal, review your course, and relax. Be sure to provide any dietary restriction information when you register. We'll have snack tables available outside of meals as well. Please bring refillable water bottles for drinks.

### Activities

We'll have events Friday and Saturday evening to help foster the orienteering community. Details coming soon.
