# Athletes' Village

We're providing a unique athletes' village experience - there will be activities on site in the evenings, easy access to all of the orienteering venues, and opportunities to meet and learn from your fellow competitors, all for a simple room and board fee.

Reserve your spot in Athletes' Village when you register for orienteering on EventReg. (Coaches, Parents, Chaperones, and other non-racers staying at Athletes' Village must also reserve a spot via Event Reg, simply click through race registration - Athlete's Village is on the very last page.)

_Final configurations are being made on EventReg, registration will open soon!_
