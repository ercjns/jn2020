## Registration FAQ

_1. Should I participate in the Friday Sprint?_

If you are eyeing a spot on the OUSA JWOC team (Junior World Orienteering Championships), you should register for the sprint in the appropriate class - Males on Red, Females on Green. Anyone else arriving in time is welcome to participate in the sprint. Results from the sprint do **NOT** contribute towards OUSA Junior Nationals awards. 

_2. What class should I register for?_

Juniors should register for the appropriate Interscholastic (IS) or Intercollegiate (IC) class based on their grade and skill level. Age based classes (F-16, M-12) should only be used by juniors who do not qualify for Junior Nationals awards (for example: non-US Juniors).

_3. What is a school team vs a club team?_

School teams consist of individuals from the same school. Club teams can be formed by individuals who wish to participate as a team but do not attend the same school. For special cases such as homeschool or head-start students, see school eligibility information in the [OUSA rules](https://orienteeringusa.org/about/rules/) section A.37.

_4. I'm a parent or coach, can I register for my family or team and only make one payment?_

Yes. First, make sure that all individuals who need to be are an OUSA member. You'll also need to be sure individuals have an updated OUSA profile or that you have all necessary contact information. Once that is complete, you can register each individual on EventReg. When you get to the waiver signing page, scroll all the way to the bottom and click "Skip Signing Waiver". On the next page, click "Register Another Orienteer for this Event" at the top. When you're done, you'll be able to make one payment.

_5. I'm a chaperone and not competing, do I need to register on EventReg?_

If you are staying at the Athlete's village at Camp Casey, sign up for those accommodations via EventReg. We do need to collect contact information, but you'll be able to skip past events and only select room and board. If you're staying off site, you do not need to register.

_6. I'm a junior staying off site, can I participate in evening social events?_

Yes, just leave an RSVP when you sign up in event reg.
