## Registration FAQ

_1. Do I need to qualify to participate?_

No. There are no qualifying times or races. Anyone may participate, but there are some requirements to be eligible for awards. In general, you must be a full time student and a current OUSA member. You can get your OUSA membership [here](https://orienteeringusa.org/membership/). See the below and the [OUSA rules](https://orienteeringusa.org/about/rules/) section A.37 for more details.

_2. Can foreign exchange students participate?_

Yes. All foreign exchange students may participate on a team, as long as they are a full-time student and have an OUSA membership. Foreign exchange students are not eligible for individual medals.

_3. I’m a grad student, can I participate in Intercollegiates?_

Yes, under the following conditions: You must be a full time student, under age 28, and not have participated in more than 3 national championship intercollegiate meets.

_4. I attend a special school (charter school, choice school, alternative school) that has no sports program, can I participate?_

Yes. You may participate on a school team for: 
- the school you attend (including if it is only for JROTC)
- your neighborhood school that you would attend if you were not at a special school
- the neighborhood school you will attend if you are running up a level.
- a “Home School” team if all students are from the same geographical area and are all home schooled

_5. Is my school limited to one team at each level?_

No. You can have multiple school teams running the same level, but you must have use different team names to differentiate which students are on which team when you register. School teams are *co-ed* and are 3-5 students running at the same level. All students from the same school must be on a school team. (If you have 6 students at the same level, you must have 2 teams of 3 students).

_6. What is a school team vs a club team? What if I don't have enough students from the same school at one level to form a team?_

School teams consist of individuals from the same school. Club teams can be formed by individuals who wish to participate as a team but do not attend the same school. For special cases such as homeschool or head-start students, see school eligibility information in the [OUSA rules](https://orienteeringusa.org/about/rules/) section A.37.

_7. Should I participate in the Friday Sprint?_

If you are eyeing a spot on the OUSA JWOC team (Junior World Orienteering Championships), you should register for the sprint using the JWOC Trials M or JWOC Trials F classes. Anyone else arriving in time Friday is welcome to participate in the sprint on Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced sprint courses. Results from the sprint do **NOT** contribute towards OUSA Junior Nationals awards. 

_8. What class should I register for?_

Juniors should register for the appropriate Interscholastic (IS) or Intercollegiate (IC) class based on their grade and skill level. Age based classes (F-16, M-12) should only be used by juniors who do not qualify for Junior Nationals awards (for example: non-US Juniors).

_9. I'm a junior staying off site, can I participate in evening social events?_

Yes, just leave an RSVP when you sign up in event reg.

_10. I'm a parent or coach, can I register for my family or team and only make one payment?_

Yes. First, make sure that all individuals who need to be are an OUSA member. You’ll also need to be sure individuals have an updated OUSA profile or that you have all necessary contact information. Once that is complete, you can register each individual on EventReg. After completing the waiver page, on the next page, click “Register Another Orienteer for this Event” at the top. When you’re done registering all individuals, you’ll be able to make one payment with the pay now button.

_11. I'm a chaperone and not competing, do I need to register on EventReg?_

If you are staying at the Athlete's village at Camp Casey, sign up for those accommodations via EventReg. We do need to collect contact information, but you'll be able to skip past events and only select room and board. If you're staying off site, you do not need to register.
